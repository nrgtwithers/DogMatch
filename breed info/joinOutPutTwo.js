These dogs also tracked and hunted wild boar, black bear, and sometimes deer. The Akita does not back down from challenges and does not frighten easily. Consequently, they are fearless and loyal guardians of their families. Yet they are also affectionate, respectful, and amusing dogs when properly trained and socialized.An Akita is bound to shed quite a bit, and you may be wiping some drool from their face if you bring one home. Certainly, owners should be prepared for some cleanup. Furthermore, they tend to be stubborn and are not overly fond of strangers. While those can be good traits for a watchdog, they will need an experienced trainer if they are to interact with other animals or people. Novices beware. That said, dogs of this breed are faithful companions that will be attached to the right owner for life and shower them with adoration and love. Therefore, if you and your family are up for the challenge and consider adopting an Akita, you’ll have a lifelong friend that won’t let you down",

This breed is more suited to the life of a companion, though the Alaskan Klee Kai shares the high energy of the Huskies and demands plenty of exercise. They also tend to be shy around strangers and are prone to expressing their emotions with whines and barks. An inexperienced owner would find it difficult to take on the challenge of caring for an Alaskan Klee Kai, but for an owner that keeps up with training and physical activity, this breed is sweet, loyal, and happy to shower loved ones with affection",

It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.Novice owners, beware. Dogs of this breed are sensitive and need plenty of companionship and open space. They are not well-suited to apartment life, and they are certainly high-shedding pooches who need plenty of grooming to keep their coats healthy. Expect to clean up dog hair all year long, and especially during shedding season. Alaskan Malamutes are high-energy dogs, and therefore require vigorous exercise. If you plan to leave them home while you’re at work, you may see some anxious, destructive behavior. A dog walker or pet sitter during the day is practically a must if you can’t be home, yourself. An Alaskan Malamute will do well with an experienced owner, lots of open space to roam and burn off energy, and a cooler climate. However, if you can meet this breed’s needs, you’ll have an intelligent, highly-trainable, loving companion for life",

They are intelligent and eager to please, which makes them highly trainable, though that intelligence means they need mental stimulation, or else they’ll put those strong jaws to use and chew anything they can find out of boredom. American Staffordshire Terriers can also use their strength to pull dog walkers along with ease wherever they want to go if they aren’t trained properly. This means they need a strong, confident trainer who will set boundaries without being overly harsh. Socialization is also important to help the breed overcome its natural standoffish tendencies when it comes to other animals. This breed loves having a job to do, and they do well in athletic competitions, police work, and obedience training. With proper training, the American Staffordshire Terrier can be a loyal cuddle bug and family companion, as well as a competent working dog",

Sometimes called the Anatolian Karabash Dog or Kangal, they’re a fiercely loyal guard dog and a large, impressive dog breed, frequently weighing 120 to 150 pounds at maturity.Novice owners beware. Not only are dogs of this breed big; they’re known to be stubborn. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs require firm, consistent trainers with experience handling dogs. Also, while grooming requirements are fairly minimal, owners should have the vacuum on standby. Be ready to clean up all the fur they shed throughout the year.A trained and well-socialized Anatolian Shepherd is a friend and guardian for anyone they consider to be their “flock,” which includes the human members of their family. They are even friendly with their human children, though their size makes it easy for them to knock over a kid during vigorous play. They may also chase other pets or animals if they owners don’t train them properly. Therefore, socialization and behavior training should start early on, ideally in puppyhood. If you’re willing to stay firm with training, you have the strength to handle a large pooch, and you’re willing to put in the time and dedication, an Anatolian Shepherd Dog will be your friend and guardian for life",

        Description: "The Australian Kelpie was originally bred to have the energy, intelligence, and independence to herd livestock all day in the hot Australian climate without much need for supervision, and the breed retains those qualities to this day. Australian Kelpies are still used across Australia and the United States for their herding instincts, and that suits these dogs just fine, as they are happiest when they have a job to do. Those who want to keep an Australian Kelpie as a pet would do well to remember that, as a bored Australian Kelpie may make their own fun by acting out and engaging in destructive behavior. The good news is that these dogs are easy to train for almost any task, so long as they have a confident, competent trainer who can give positive reinforcement without being too harsh. Australian Kelpies are fully capable of performing many dog sports, search and rescue work, nose work, service dog duties, and more. They have high energy and high exercise needs, and while they are able to handle doing a job with little supervision, they need human companionship and direction. Leaving them home alone for long periods of time can spell disaster. Their natural herding instincts need to be contained and used properly from an early age, or they may end up nipping at the heels of children, other pets, and even guests, but with time and training, they can make loyal companions who excel as watchdogs and work tirelessly at any task they’re given",

        Description: "The Bernese Mountain Dog is an extremely versatile working dog from the farmlands of Switzerland. They were developed to herd cattle, pull carts, and be watchdogs and loyal companions. They are one of four types of Swiss Mountain Dogs, and the only one with long hair. The Bernese Mountain Dog comes from the canton of Bern, hence his name. They’re a large and sturdy dog breed, with a friendly and calm disposition, and they’re also well-suited to conformation, obedience, tracking, herding, and carting competitions.A novice dog owner might be attracted to this breed’s friendly disposition, intelligence, and highly trainable nature. However, first-time dog owners should beware. The Bernese Mountain Dog’s size and high energy can make handling difficult. Thus, they don’t appreciate being cooped up in apartments all day. They shed a lot, and they tend to need the drool wiped from their faces every once in a while. Dogs of this breed are great watchdogs, but that also means they have a tendency to bark–loudly. They may want to chase smaller animals and play roughly, even though they are quite gentle when fully mature and trained properly.Although, for an experienced owner who can match the Bernese’s energy, provide open space, keep up with grooming, and dedicate time and effort to training, this breed will show unconditional love and loyalty. A well-trained Bernese makes an excellent companion that will adore the whole family. They love kids and will even greet newcomers to the home warmly, so long as they’ve had adequate socialization training. There aren’t many breeds with a greater predisposition for friendliness. Therefore, if you’re ready for the challenge, you’ll never regret adopting a Bernese Mountain Dog",

        Description: "Energetic, fearless, and strong, the Black Mouth Cur is valued as an all-around working dog bred to help farmers and hunters in the rugged terrain of the southeastern United States. The breed is capable of herding livestock, providing protection for the home, and tracking game, though it also has a sensitive side that doesn’t respond well to harsh rebukes or punishment. The Black Mouth Cur loves being around humans and family, and it is excellent with children, though high exercise needs make this breed a poor choice for inexperienced owners or those who are unable to keep up with a demanding energy level, and its tendency to play rough may not be best for children that are very young. Black Mouth Curs are mostly found in the United States and are a bit rare in other parts of the world.

Known as the “Black Pearls of Russia,” Blackies are people-oriented and want to be close to the action at all times. They tend to be a bit aloof around strangers, including dogs they don’t know, but they’re devoted to their families — and they don’t bark or shed much. They have large bones and well-developed muscles, creating a vibrant, flowing impression. Like Henry Ford’s first cars, Blackies are available in black, black, or black",

        Description: "The Blue Lacy, also called the Lacy Dog, is an energetic, intelligent, and trainable breed that loves having a job to do and a lot of open space to run around. Even though the breed has “Blue” in its name, Blue Lacys can also have red or tri-colored coats, though they all carry the blue color gene. The “Lacy” in the breed’s name does not refer to the dog’s appearance at all, but rather comes from the name of the family that first created the breed. The Blue Lacy was developed in the 1800s to help with herding, hunting, and ranch work in Texas. These dogs are hardy, adaptable, and able to learn quickly, though their high intensity and energy level make them ill-suited for apartment life or novice owners. Blue Lacys can make great family dogs and expert watchdogs with firm training, but they are sensitive and don’t respond well to punishment. Socialization should begin early, as Blue Lacys are naturally territorial, not overly trusting of strangers, and have a high prey drive that can cause them to attack smaller animals and pets if they aren’t socialized. With confident, assertive training that relies on positive reinforcement, dogs of this breed can be loyal, protective, and capable members of the family that are eager to please. Experienced owners that are ready to give this dog a task will be rewarded with a lifelong friend that will rise to any challenge",

These gigantic protectors were bred to help farmers in South Africa defend their homesteads from hyenas, lions, and all manner of deadly wildlife while also providing invaluable companionship. The Boerboel, pronounced “boo-r-bull,” gets its name from Dutch/Afrikaans words that roughly translate to “farmer’s dog.” It is also known as the South African Mastiff, South African Boerboel, Borbull, or Bole. Although Boerboels are generally docile, easy to groom, and have few health problems, don’t make the mistake of thinking they’re an easy breed to handle for first time owners. These dogs are confident, territorial, and prone to pulling and chewing. They need an assertive, experienced owner with plenty of space for a massive dog that needs to exercise. If you’re interested in adopting a Boerboel, make sure you and your home are ready for the challenge. If you are, you’ll be rewarded with a loyal, protective friend for life",

This massive breed is highly territorial and won’t back down from a fight, even against bears or wolves. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are intelligent, but their stubborn, independent nature can make them difficult to train, and their natural distrust of strangers and other animals can lead to aggressive tendencies if they are not kept in check by an experienced trainer. This breed is not a good choice for novice owners, and though they are fairly low-energy dogs, the sheer size of Caucasian Shepherd Dogs makes them poorly suited for apartment living and homes with small children. Still, with proper training and socialization, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can be strong watchdogs, family companions, and even therapy dogs. While they may not appeal to first-time dog owners, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs will reward experienced, patient, consistent trainers with gentle love and affection that will make them excellent lifelong family members",

They are also known as Italian Water Dogs and Romagna Water Dogs. Today, with many of the marshlands of the breed’s homeland drained, these dogs have found a new purpose in truffle hunting. Owners can easily train them to use their super noses for scent work, and Lagottos’ thick coats help them stay warm in fall and winter while protecting them from thorns and debris as they run through forests.They are the only dogs bred for the specific purpose of truffle hunting in modern times, and their keen sense of smell and natural tendency to dig make them experts at the task. Lagotto Romagnolos can also make loving, active, easygoing household pets with few demands. Their hypoallergenic coats are good for allergy sufferers, though those coats require a good deal of maintenance. So, if you are capable of keeping up with grooming and brushing and you want a dedicated, easily-trained family companion–or someone to help you hunt for delicious truffles–the Lagotto Romagnolo may be a great dog for you",

He could have a stubby tail, spindly legs, a giant spot over his left eye — or all three. A divine inspiration, the mixed breed is gloriously, wonderfully someone else’s design.And as the ultimate family dog, the mixed breed excels where the purebred lacks. Drawing from a broader, more diverse gene pool, his intensity is softer than his pedigreed cousins, his drives and compulsions mercifully muted. The Mutt’s loyalty, warmth, and deep desire to please, however, remain as fiercely intact as any dog you could choose to create",

In fact, their affectionate nature makes them poor watchdogs. That’s because they are likely to react to strangers with warm greetings instead of barks or growls. As a relatively new breed, the Silken Windhound is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, though it was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2011 and appears in shows and competitions around the world.Silken Windhounds can be trained for obedience, agility, and dog sports. Furthermore, they tend to pick up such training quickly and easily with their intelligence and desire to please the humans that they are close to. However their high prey drive must be redirected into positive behavior or they may bolt after small animals and wander.Although these dogs are easygoing most of the time and are happy to curl up on the couch with their families, they also have bursts of high energy and require exercise in the form of at least one long walk or run per day. If their exercise needs are met, they are happy to adapt to almost any living situation, including apartment life.Their long, beautiful coats come in a variety of patterns and colors, and despite their luxurious looks, they are surprisingly easy to maintain and do not shed excessively. Silken Windhounds make great, active family companions for novice and experienced owners, alike, and their long life span will keep them around for many years of love and affection",

        Description: "A fun-loving “designer dog” — and therefore a mixed dog breed — a Yorkipoo is a cross between the Yorkshire Terrier and a Toy or Miniature Poodle. Intelligent, affectionate, and gentle, he makes a delightful companion and is perfectly suited to apartment life, especially if you don’t mind the barking. He has plenty of energy to be burned off and he loves to play when he’s not parked on your lap watching the world go by. His ability to run fast and jump high can be surprising to those who aren’t expecting a canine Superman in miniature",
