            Description: "The Akita is a large and powerful dog breed with a noble and intimidating presence. They were originally used for guarding royalty and nobility in feudal Japan. These dogs also tracked and hunted wild boar, black bear, and sometimes deer. The Akita does not back down from challenges and does not frighten easily. Consequently, they are fearless and loyal guardians of their families. Yet they are also affectionate, respectful, and amusing dogs when properly trained and socialized.An Akita is bound to shed quite a bit, and you may be wiping some drool from their face if you bring one home. Certainly, owners should be prepared for some cleanup. Furthermore, they tend to be stubborn and are not overly fond of strangers. While those can be good traits for a watchdog, they will need an experienced trainer if they are to interact with other animals or people. Novices beware. That said, dogs of this breed are faithful companions that will be attached to the right owner for life and shower them with adoration and love. Therefore, if you and your family are up for the challenge and consider adopting an Akita, you’ll have a lifelong friend that won’t let you down."

            Description: "Small, smart, and energetic, the Alaskan Klee Kai is a relatively new breed that looks like a smaller version of the Siberian Husky, and even the name “Klee Kai” comes from an Inuit term meaning “small dog.” While Alaskan Klee Kais may resemble larger Husky breeds, they have some key differences, especially when it comes to temperament, that distinguish it from its ancestor working class dogs of the north. This breed is more suited to the life of a companion, though the Alaskan Klee Kai shares the high energy of the Huskies and demands plenty of exercise. They also tend to be shy around strangers and are prone to expressing their emotions with whines and barks. An inexperienced owner would find it difficult to take on the challenge of caring for an Alaskan Klee Kai, but for an owner that keeps up with training and physical activity, this breed is sweet, loyal, and happy to shower loved ones with affection."

            Description: "The Alaskan Malamute features a powerful, sturdy body built for stamina and strength. It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.Novice owners, beware. Dogs of this breed are sensitive and need plenty of companionship and open space. They are not well-suited to apartment life, and they are certainly high-shedding pooches who need plenty of grooming to keep their coats healthy. Expect to clean up dog hair all year long, and especially during shedding season. Alaskan Malamutes are high-energy dogs, and therefore require vigorous exercise. If you plan to leave them home while you’re at work, you may see some anxious, destructive behavior. A dog walker or pet sitter during the day is practically a must if you can’t be home, yourself. An Alaskan Malamute will do well with an experienced owner, lots of open space to roam and burn off energy, and a cooler climate. However, if you can meet this breed’s needs, you’ll have an intelligent, highly-trainable, loving companion for life."

            Description: "The American Staffordshire Terrier is a muscular breed that is known for being strong for its size, yet loving and affectionate with its human family. American Staffordshire Terriers enjoy nothing more than being with the humans they care about, whether they’re out for a jog, playing in the yard, or cuddling up on the couch. They are intelligent and eager to please, which makes them highly trainable, though that intelligence means they need mental stimulation, or else they’ll put those strong jaws to use and chew anything they can find out of boredom. American Staffordshire Terriers can also use their strength to pull dog walkers along with ease wherever they want to go if they aren’t trained properly. This means they need a strong, confident trainer who will set boundaries without being overly harsh. Socialization is also important to help the breed overcome its natural standoffish tendencies when it comes to other animals. This breed loves having a job to do, and they do well in athletic competitions, police work, and obedience training. With proper training, the American Staffordshire Terrier can be a loyal cuddle bug and family companion, as well as a competent working dog."

They were created with specific traits to resemble the size and color of livestock they defended so predators wouldn’t detect them among the flock. Sometimes called the Anatolian Karabash Dog or Kangal, they’re a fiercely loyal guard dog and a large, impressive dog breed, frequently weighing 120 to 150 pounds at maturity.Novice owners beware. Not only are dogs of this breed big; they’re known to be stubborn. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs require firm, consistent trainers with experience handling dogs. Also, while grooming requirements are fairly minimal, owners should have the vacuum on standby. Be ready to clean up all the fur they shed throughout the year.A trained and well-socialized Anatolian Shepherd is a friend and guardian for anyone they consider to be their “flock,” which includes the human members of their family. They are even friendly with their human children, though their size makes it easy for them to knock over a kid during vigorous play. They may also chase other pets or animals if they owners don’t train them properly. Therefore, socialization and behavior training should start early on, ideally in puppyhood. If you’re willing to stay firm with training, you have the strength to handle a large pooch, and you’re willing to put in the time and dedication, an Anatolian Shepherd Dog will be your friend and guardian for life."

Australian Kelpies are still used across Australia and the United States for their herding instincts, and that suits these dogs just fine, as they are happiest when they have a job to do. Those who want to keep an Australian Kelpie as a pet would do well to remember that, as a bored Australian Kelpie may make their own fun by acting out and engaging in destructive behavior. The good news is that these dogs are easy to train for almost any task, so long as they have a confident, competent trainer who can give positive reinforcement without being too harsh. Australian Kelpies are fully capable of performing many dog sports, search and rescue work, nose work, service dog duties, and more. They have high energy and high exercise needs, and while they are able to handle doing a job with little supervision, they need human companionship and direction. Leaving them home alone for long periods of time can spell disaster. Their natural herding instincts need to be contained and used properly from an early age, or they may end up nipping at the heels of children, other pets, and even guests, but with time and training, they can make loyal companions who excel as watchdogs and work tirelessly at any task they’re given."

They were developed to herd cattle, pull carts, and be watchdogs and loyal companions. They are one of four types of Swiss Mountain Dogs, and the only one with long hair. The Bernese Mountain Dog comes from the canton of Bern, hence his name. They’re a large and sturdy dog breed, with a friendly and calm disposition, and they’re also well-suited to conformation, obedience, tracking, herding, and carting competitions.A novice dog owner might be attracted to this breed’s friendly disposition, intelligence, and highly trainable nature. However, first-time dog owners should beware. The Bernese Mountain Dog’s size and high energy can make handling difficult. Thus, they don’t appreciate being cooped up in apartments all day. They shed a lot, and they tend to need the drool wiped from their faces every once in a while. Dogs of this breed are great watchdogs, but that also means they have a tendency to bark–loudly. They may want to chase smaller animals and play roughly, even though they are quite gentle when fully mature and trained properly.Although, for an experienced owner who can match the Bernese’s energy, provide open space, keep up with grooming, and dedicate time and effort to training, this breed will show unconditional love and loyalty. A well-trained Bernese makes an excellent companion that will adore the whole family. They love kids and will even greet newcomers to the home warmly, so long as they’ve had adequate socialization training. There aren’t many breeds with a greater predisposition for friendliness.

Even though the breed has “Blue” in its name, Blue Lacys can also have red or tri-colored coats, though they all carry the blue color gene. The “Lacy” in the breed’s name does not refer to the dog’s appearance at all, but rather comes from the name of the family that first created the breed. The Blue Lacy was developed in the 1800s to help with herding, hunting, and ranch work in Texas. These dogs are hardy, adaptable, and able to learn quickly, though their high intensity and energy level make them ill-suited for apartment life or novice owners. Blue Lacys can make great family dogs and expert watchdogs with firm training, but they are sensitive and don’t respond well to punishment. Socialization should begin early, as Blue Lacys are naturally territorial, not overly trusting of strangers, and have a high prey drive that can cause them to attack smaller animals and pets if they aren’t socialized.

This massive breed is highly territorial and won’t back down from a fight, even against bears or wolves. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are intelligent, but their stubborn, independent nature can make them difficult to train, and their natural distrust of strangers and other animals can lead to aggressive tendencies if they are not kept in check by an experienced trainer. This breed is not a good choice for novice owners, and though they are fairly low-energy dogs, the sheer size of Caucasian Shepherd Dogs makes them poorly suited for apartment living and homes with small children. Still, with proper training and socialization, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can be strong watchdogs, family companions, and even therapy dogs. While they may not appeal to first-time dog owners, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs will reward experienced, patient, consistent trainers with gentle love and affection that will make them excellent lifelong family members."

Bred solely to be a companion, the Shih Tzu is an affectionate, happy, outgoing housedog who loves nothing more than to follow his people from room to room. In recent years, however, owners have started taking the Shih Tzu off their laps and into dog sports, training him for obedience, rally, and agility competitions."

            Description: "The Siberian Husky is a beautiful dog breed with a thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia. It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but be aware that this athletic, intelligent dog can be independent and challenging for first-time dog owners. Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini and need a fenced yard that is sunk in the ground to prevent escapes."

            Description: "The Silken Windhound is an affectionate, playful, and eager-to-please dog breed that is easily trained and loves families, including those with small children and pets. In fact, their affectionate nature makes them poor watchdogs. That’s because they are likely to react to strangers with warm greetings instead of barks or growls. As a relatively new breed, the Silken Windhound is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, though it was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2011 and appears in shows and competitions around the world.Silken Windhounds can be trained for obedience, agility, and dog sports. Furthermore, they tend to pick up such training quickly and easily with their intelligence and desire to please the humans that they are close to. However their high prey drive must be redirected into positive behavior or they may bolt after small animals and wander.Although these dogs are easygoing most of the time and are happy to curl up on the couch with their families, they also have bursts of high energy and require exercise in the form of at least one long walk or run per day. If their exercise needs are met, they are happy to adapt to almost any living situation, including apartment life.Their long, beautiful coats come in a variety of patterns and colors, and despite their luxurious looks, they are surprisingly easy to maintain and do not shed excessively. Silken Windhounds make great, active family companions for novice and experienced owners, alike, and their long life span will keep them around for many years of love and affection."
